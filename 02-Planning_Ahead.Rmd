# Planning Ahead
## Prepare for Success
 - Learning Objectives:
   - Learn the KISS method
   - Establish good version control and CI / Test
   - Comprehend development team hierarchy

>French proverb: Rome ne fut pas faite toute en un jour.

>English Translation: Rome was not made all in one day.

 - The chapter is preparing for a project
 - Projects that aren't planned well encure additional cost to unwrangle bad code
 - Setting Version Control
 - Organizing a hierarchy of personnel
 
> The sooner you start with a robust framework the better, and the longer you wait the harder it gets to convert your application to a production-ready one.

## Develop with the *KISS* principle
Definition: Keep It Simple Stupid

- Kelly Johnson of Lockheed Skunkworks
  - Develop with a common set of tools
    - Tidyverse
    - Dplyr
    - ggplot2
    - etc...
  
Expand on this topic for military style of *lowest common denominator*. Simple is success.

- Various levels of workforce aptitude lead towards varying degrees of success
- If your team chooses to use abstract packages or web applications, ensure there is a good reason. The more complex you build your orchestration, the harder it will be to find talent to maintain the service. Example: Microsoft or Oracle

## Working as a team: Tools and structure
- The choice of tools and how the team is structured is crucial for a successful application.
  - Not entirely like *KISS*, but close too it. GitHub versus GitLab. Barebones hardware or Containerization.
 
### From the tools point of view
1. Version control and test all things
 - Use Constant Innovation (CI) principles to test all code before committing
 - Breaking things is a natural process of software engineering, notably when working on a piece of code during a long period
 - Be informed that the codebase is broken
 - Be able to identify changes between versions, and potentially, get back in time to a previous codebase
   - Github/GitLab diff-docs. Example: Branch -> Change -> Test -> Commit -> Pull Request -> Merge
2. Small is beautiful
 - Smaller more managable pieces make it easier to develop
 - Teams may even work in parallel (with caution)
 - A large codebase implies that the safe way to work is to split the app into pieces
 - Extract your core “non-reactive” functions, which we will also call the “business logic”, and include them in external files
   - Non-vital linkages (data ingestion pipelines)
   - Page Layout and theming (CSS or branding characteristics)
   - Allows for expansion but won't break the core

### From the team point of view
 - Select a Manager, maybe a stakeholder or project manager. Someone who may or may not work on the codebase but is aware and knowledgeable
 - Select one or more core developers skilled but specific in their field of study
 - Follow *git workflow* with issue tracking and managing pull requests
