# Building an Ipsum App

## Learning Outcomes

- Importance of Prototyping

- Guide the client's focus

- Use different tools for prototyping different parts of an app

- Decouple UI, reactivity, and back-end

## Tools

- {shinipsum}

- {fakir}

- `usethis::use_vignette`

## Prototyping is crucial

### Prototype, then polish

- Make things work before working on low-level optimization

  - This makes the engineering process easier
  
- Abstraction is hard, and makes the codebase harder to work with

- It's hard to identify bottlenecks up front

- It's easier to spot mistakes when you have something that can run

### The "UI first" approach

- helps when clarifying:
  
  - what the app is supposed to do
  
  - how the app is to work
  
  - what each team-member is to work on
  
- use "the least possible computation"

- focus on appearance and interactions

## Prototyping {shiny}

### Fast UI prototyping with {shinipsum}

{shinipsum}

- generates random shiny elements

- example apps:
  - [https://engineering-shiny.org/shinipsum/]()
  - [https://engineering-shiny.org/golemhtmltemplate/]()

- `shinipsum::random_ggplot() + labs(title = "Random plot")`

- See example app in the book

- Also suggest {fakir} as source of example / fake datasets for use while building app

## Building with RMarkdown

### Define the content of the application

### Using the Rmd files as a laboratory notebook

### Rmd, Vignettes, and documentation first
