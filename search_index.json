That is a lot of scrolling! Working with a bite-sized codebase if you copy and paste something more than twice, you should make a function {shiny} modules aim at three things: simplify “id” namespacing split the codebase into a series of functions allow UI/Server parts of your app to be reused Most of the time, modules are used to do the two first. In our case, we could say that 90% of the modules we write are never reused, they are here to allow us to split the codebase into smaller, more manageable pieces. 3.2.2 When to use {shiny} modules Start right from the beginning Yes, this takes a bit more time, but you will be saving yourselve volumes in the future (Your future self will love you!) 3.2.3 A practical walkthrough (Big code base example.

They are the backbone of the application and may not be specific to a given module. They can be added using {golem} with the add_fct(“name”) function. mod_* files contain a unique module. Many {shiny} apps contain a series of tabs, or at least a tab-like pattern, so we suggest that you number them according to their step in the application. Tabs are almost always named in the user interface, so that you can use this tab name as the file name. For example, if you build a dashboard where the first tab is called “Import”, you should name your file mod_01_import.R. You can create this file with a module skeleton using golem::add_module(“01_import”). utils_* are files that contain utilities, which are small helper functions. For example, you might want to have a not_na, which is not_na &lt;- Negate(is.na), a not_null, or small tools that you will be using application-wide. Note that you can also create utils for a specific module. *_ui_*, for example utils_ui.R, relates to the user interface. *_server_* are files that contain anything related to the application’s back-end. For example, fct_connection_server.R will contain functions that are related to the connection to a database, and are specifically used from the server side.

Simon To be failing gracefully and informatively can sometimes happen, but do not forget to put an informative bug message to avoid a grayish version of the application. Under some conditions you might not have the complete manner of all that is linked with your app (such as widgets in {DT} package) Good practices: add a bug message wrap all server calls (in case of crash reduce the amount of data loss) use a notification function with {shinyalert} and/or {attempt} packages As an example, if we want our app to be connected to a database, we use connect_db() connection in the server(). If the connection fails, we notify the user: conn &lt;- attempt::attempt({ connect_db() }) if (attempt::is_try_error(conn)){ # Notify the user send_notification(&quot;Could not connect&quot;) } else { # Continue computing if the connection was successful continue_computing() } 6.2.2 Building a self-evident app (or at least self-explanatory) self-evident: no demo required self-explanatory: no explanation required A.

Many general Git tools require authentication. The information that is needed is your PAT. You can stored your PAT with gitcreds::gitcreds_set() command. Once this is done correctly you don’t need to do that again unless you require more strict rules on your VC tool, so that it might require you to regularly update your credentials.1 The basic commands in Git are: add: info or other addition to the project (i.e. Add a line to README and verify that Git notices the change) commit: engage the content with the repository (i.e. in RStudio click the bottom “commit” in the pane section of GitHub) The “commit” button creates a unique commit reference number: sha# And allows the user to make a comment about the commit, so to advise the others in the project or to remind the user about it. push: send the content to the server and so to the repository pull: receive the changes/updates from the repository 12.2.3 About branches The “main” branch is the one that appears at the beginning of the project, but other branches can be created. Secondary branches are work areas, usually for the other in the team to have a further layer of security of the “main” content. When you work on a shared project, your collaborators need to name a new branch to interact with the repository. This imply the creation of mirrored repositories that can be absolutely equal or slightly different, as the requested additions/modifications are accepted. 12.2.4 Issues Issues are another way to advise the main repository of some modifications that would be needed. They are used to propose changes, to track a bug or to suggest a feature, and can be done directly by the GitHub page of the repository. An issue creates a “message exchange” form of communication with the repository owner, for advising about something that can be improved. happygitwithr.com↩︎ "],["git-integration.html", "12.3 Git integration", " 12.3 Git integration 12.3.1 With RStudio In our case we are interested in how to use GitHub with RStudio, and how to set it up in a new project.

It is intended as the Git workflow, and it relates with differentiating the use of the main branch with the developer (dev) branch which is the “working in progress”.

Regularly run git stash, git rebase dev, and git stash apply to include the latest changes from dev to stay synchronized with dev. Make a pull request to dev so that the feature is included. Once the PR is accepted by the project manager, notify the rest of the team that there have been changes to dev, so they can rebase it to the branch they are working on.

(Example of the implemented structure: {hexmake} (Fay 2021g)) A practical example of the implementation uses an environment to store the value. So, do not rely on any reactive value invalidating the reactive context, but the result is rendered on when “render2” flag is triggered.

Logging is a way to access the log file of the app. It is used to debug the app’s code, and it is a useful feature when debugging someone else’s code. The log file is where all the steps taken by the app are registered, it tells you what your app is doing. So that, being able to access the log file and locate the part that is to be debugged is an important task. To facilitate the location of the “part of the shiny code that is to be debugged” a warning is positioned for simplification of the procedure. There are several packages in R that provide useful functions for logging, here we talk about some specific packages to use within a shiny app. ….whereami is one of them. {whereami} return where the script is run from Figure 15.4: {whereami} package whereami::whereami() (Sidi and Müller 2019 - github ) For example, whereami() function let’s you locate the name of the file you are working on: library(whereami) whereami::whereami() ## ── Running From: ./bookclub-epgs.Rmd ─────────────────────────────────────────── Then, as classical procedure, with the use of the base::cat() function within the logging procedure, the cat_where() function in {whereami} package, helps you to producing an output in a user-defined function. It converts arguments to character vectors and, concatenates them to a single character vector, in the locate file. Where should it be located? If it is added to the app_server(), it will print the location of the function call to the logs. The combination with cat_where() will implement a reactive logging to the console while developing or debugging an app. whereami::cat_where( whereami::whereami() ) cat_where(where, type = c(&quot;rule&quot;, &quot;boxx&quot;, &quot;bullet&quot;, &quot;line&quot;, &quot;print&quot;), color = &quot;some_colors&quot;, ...) Another feature is to get a list of all the counters: the numbers of time each of the located cat functions have been called and plot the statistics of the usage. whereami::counter_get() plot(whereami::counter_get()) Figure 15.5: {whereami} package As an example: library(whereami) require(ggplot2) ggplot(iris) + aes(x=Sepal.Length,y=Sepal.Width) + geom_point() + labs(caption = sprintf(&#39;sourced from: %s&#39;,whereami())) In this context, it is everything we need to know about logging with whereami.

But then, again, JavaScript is a HUGE subject! JavaScript is maintained by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). JavaScript is often referred to as ECMA Script. Where do I use Javascript? Here are just a few examples: Interactive Webpages (Radio Buttons, Text Entry, dynamic changing of page attributes) eLearning (SCORM, xAPI) Data Visualization (D3JS) You are using it to Knit this Markdown as well as provide all sorts of interaction! Javascript is one of three primary standards that make up the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Other standards include: HyperText Markup Language (HTML) Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Standard Vectors Graphics (SVG) jQuery (a derivative of JavaScript. Considered more lightweight) Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (AJAX) This may all appear confusing, but the reality is, most R developers who deploy {shiny} apps may not even leave RStudio. Therefore, one could claim the primary reason for adding additional JavaScript is to add hyper performance to your web app! Note, at this point, I’m not calling it a {shiny} anymore, but a web app. But what is going on under the hood? {shiny} binds events to UI elements, and these JavaScript events will communicate with R R talks to your browser through a web socket Communication happens in both directions "],["a-quick-introduction-to-javascript.html", "17.2 A quick introduction to JavaScript", " 17.2 A quick introduction to JavaScript The fastest way to interact with JavaScript is from the Developer Tools of your favorite browser For example, enter the following in your Dev Tools Console: var message = \"Hello World\"; alert(message); 17.2.1 Including JavaScript code in your app There are three primary ways to include JavaScript code in your app: As an external file Inside a &lt;script&gt;Your Code snippet goes here&lt;/script&gt; tag Inline, on a specific tag The recommended practice is through an external file. If you are developing with {golem}, there are two primary functions to include JavaScript. They are: golem::add_js_file(\"name\"), this adds a standard JavaScript file. This method is not intended to communicate with R golem::add_js_handler(\"name\"), this is intended to work with R golem::add_js_binding(\"name\"), for advanced, customer interaction for your shiny app 17.2.2 Understanding HTML, class, and id Think of your Web Page as a tree where the top of the page is your root node. Referenced as the Document Object Model (DOM) You can work on any of these HTML nodes with JavaScript The following code snippets compare R code to its corresponding HTML output: library(shiny) fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;Hello Shiny&quot;), textInput(&quot;act&quot;, &quot;Input&quot;) ) And its corresponding HTML: &lt;div class=&quot;container-fluid&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hello Shiny&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;form-group shiny-input-container&quot;&gt; &lt;label class=&quot;control-label&quot; for=&quot;act&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;act&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; We can see we created a div tag with a Bootstrap container, an h2 tag for text, and a text input field with and id and class. NOTE: id must be unique. This is how the websockets can communicate Elements can have a class which can apply to multiple elements. This can be used in JavaScript, but it is also very useful for styling elements in CSS. 17.2.3 Querying in Vanilla JavaScript The term Vanilla JavaScript refers to plain JavaScript, meaning, not external plugins. // Given &lt;div id = &quot;first&quot; name=&quot;number&quot; class = &quot;widediv&quot;&gt;Hey&lt;/div&gt; // Query with the ID document.querySelector(&quot;#first&quot;) document.getElementById(&quot;first&quot;) // With the class document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.widediv&quot;) document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;widediv&quot;) // With the name attribute document.getElementsByName(&quot;number&quot;) // Using the tag name document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;div&quot;) This method comes with a hitch! Not all Browsers are created equal! This brings another angle of development consideration to our software development process. With relation to proprietary frameworks and a host of different Browser vendors (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, etc…) not all JavaScript versions are recognized. 17.2.4 About DOM Events Within the Document Object Model, interactions are called events. JavaScript runtime is listening for these events. Better yet, this is were we can control the interaction of our users with our {shiny} apps. The following are examples of events: click / dblclick focus keypress, keydown, keyup mousedown, mouseenter, mouseleave, mousemove, mouseout, mouseover, mouseup scroll For a full list of these events, please visit this link. Once you have this list in mind, you can select elements in the DOM, add an addEventListener to them, and define a callback function (which is executed when the event is triggered) &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id = &quot;firstinput&quot;&gt; &lt;script&gt; document.getElementById(&quot;firstinput&quot;).addEventListener( &quot;keypress&quot;, function(){ alert(&quot;Pressed!&quot;) } ) &lt;/script&gt; Another example is to send an alert when the Shiny Server is connected: $(document).on(&#39;shiny:connected&#39;, function(event) { alert(&#39;Connected to the server&#39;); }); The $() is considered jQuery and is a subset, lighter weight, more widely recognized method of running JavaScript. 17.2.5 About jQuery and jQuery selectors jQuery is native to the {shiny} package. Examples of jQuery include: $(\"#firstinput\") to refer to the element with the id firstinput $(\".widediv\") to refer to element(s) of class widediv $(\"button:contains('this')\") to refer to the buttons with a text containing 'this' &lt;a href = &quot;https://thinkr.fr&quot; data-value = &quot;panel2&quot;&gt;ThinkR&lt;/a&gt; We can interact with these attributes using jQuery: $(\"a[href = 'https://thinkr.fr']\") refers to link(s) with href being https://thinkr.fr $('a[data-value=\"panel2\"]') refers to link(s) with data-value being \"panel2\" NOTE: jQuery has the advantage of simplifying selections and actions and is a cross-platform library "],["client-side-javascript.html", "17.3 Client-Side JavaScript", " 17.3 Client-Side JavaScript This whole topic is related to JavaScript, but is stated with relation to R and Shiny. These three are all intertwined with each other. If extend beyond R and {shiny}, you can expand the interaction of your web app. Examples include: Small JavaScript functions that will prevent you from writing complex algorithmic logic in your application server. alert(\"message\") is a built-in alert-box mechanism. This is built into the user’s browser and can replace a call to the server, like shinyalert. var x = prompt(\"this\", \"that\"); is a function that opens a built-in prompt window. We can recieve input and store it in a variable for future use. 17.3.1 Common Patterns Examples of Client-Side use of JavaScript: alert(\"message\") is a built-in alert-box mechanism. This is built into the user’s browser and can replace a call to the server, like shinyalert. var x = prompt(\"this\", \"that\"); is a function that opens a built-in prompt window. We can recieve input and store it in a variable for future use. $('#id').css('color', 'green');, or in vanilla JavaScript document.getElementById(\"demo\").style.color = \"green\"; changes the CSS attributes of the selected element(s). Here, we are switching to green on the #id element. $(\"#id\").text(\"this\"), or in vanilla JavaScript document.getElementById(\"id\").innerText = \"this\"; changes the text content to “this”. $(\"#id\").remove();, or in vanilla JavaScript var elem = document.querySelector('#some-element'); elem.parentNode.removeChild(elem); completely removes the element from the DOM. It can be used as a replacement for shiny::removeUI(), or as a conditional UI. Note that this code doesn’t remove the input values on the server side: the elements only disappear from the UI, but nothing is sent to the server side. 17.3.2 Where to put them: Back to JavaScript Events It is great we are discussing all levels of JavaScript implementation…but where to put them? Here are some examples of adding JavaScript functions to DOM events: onclick The onclick attribute can be added straight inside the HTML tag when possible: # Building a button using the native HTML tag # (i.e. not using the actionButton() function) # This button only goal is to launch this JS code # when it is clicked tags$button( &quot;Show&quot;, onclick = &quot;$(&#39;#plot&#39;).show()&quot; ) Or with shiny::tagAppendAttributes(): # Using tagAppendAttributes() allows to add attributes to the # outputed UI element plotOutput( &quot;plot&quot; ) %&gt;% tagAppendAttributes( onclick = &quot;alert(&#39;hello world&#39;)&quot; ) Here is, for example, a small {shiny} app that implements this behavior: library(shiny) library(magrittr) ui &lt;- function(){ fluidPage( # We create a plotOutput, which will show an alert when # it is clicked plotOutput( &quot;plot&quot; ) %&gt;% tagAppendAttributes( onclick = &quot;alert(&#39;iris plot!&#39;)&quot; ) ) } server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ output$plot &lt;- renderPlot({ plot(iris) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) Lets put this into Golem!!! Use the add_js_file(\"name\") function in Golem. In /inst/app/www/script.js function alertme(id){ // Asking information var name = prompt(&quot;Who are you?&quot;); // Showing an alert alert(&quot;Hello &quot; + name + &quot;! You&#39;re seeing &quot; + id); } Then in R plotOutput( &quot;plot&quot; ) %&gt;% tagAppendAttributes( # Calling the function which has been defined in the # external script onclick = &quot;alertme(&#39;plot&#39;)&quot; ) Last example, you can also add jQuery calls too! Inside this inst/app/www/script.js, you can also attach a new behavior with jQuery to one or several elements. For example, you can add this alertme / onclick behavior to all plots of the app: function alertme(id){ var name = prompt(&quot;Who are you?&quot;); alert(&quot;Hello &quot; + name + &quot;! You&#39;re seeing &quot; + id); } /* We&#39;re adding this so that the function is launched only when the document is ready */ $(function(){ // Selecting all `{shiny}` plots $(&quot;.shiny-plot-output&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, function(){ /* Calling the alertme function with the id of the clicked plot */ alertme(this.id); }); }); We’ve unpacked a lot here…but there is more.

Using the skeleton from golem::add_js_handler(\"first_handler\"), we get this snippet: $( document ).ready(function() { Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(&#39;fun&#39;, function(arg) { }) }); Then, you can call it from the server side: session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;fun&quot;, list()) # OR golem::invoke_js(&quot;fun&quot;, ...) NOTE: the list() argument will be coverted to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and read via JavaScript. If we have function x and variables a and b, then we can use the dot notation of x.a and x.b in our JavaScript. For Example: // We define a handler called &quot;computed&quot;, that can be called // from the server side of the {shiny} application Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(&#39;computed&#39;, function(mess) { // The received value (in mess) is serialized in JSON, // so we can access the list element with object.name alert(&quot;Computed &quot; + mess.what + &quot; in &quot; + mess.sec + &quot; secs&quot;); }) And within R: observe({ # Register the starting time deb &lt;- Sys.time() # Mimic a long computation Sys.sleep( sample(1:5, 1) ) # Calling the computed handler golem::invoke_js( &quot;computed&quot;, # We send a list, that will be turned into JSON list( what = &quot;time&quot;, sec = round(Sys.time() - deb) ) ) }) 17.4.2 From JavaScript to R How can you do the opposite (send JavaScript calls to R)? There is an object called Shiny within your browser. This object can be used to send values to R by creating an InputValue. // This function from the Shiny JavaScript object // Allows to register an input name, and a value Shiny.setInputValue(&quot;rand&quot;, Math.random()) You bind an input which can be caut fro the server side using: # Once the input is set, it can be caught with R using: observeEvent( input$rand , { print( input$rand ) }) Shiny.setInputValue cn be used inside any JavaScript function. As an example we use the following code snippet: In inst/app/www/script.js function alertme(){ var name = prompt(&quot;Who are you?&quot;); alert(&quot;Hello &quot; + name + &quot;! Welcome to my app&quot;); Shiny.setInputValue(&quot;username&quot;, name) } $(function(){ // Waiting for `{shiny}` to be connected $(document).on(&#39;shiny:connected&#39;, function(event) { alertme(); }); $(&quot;.shiny-plot-output&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, function(){ /* Calling the alertme function with the id of the clicked plot. The `this` object here refers to the clicked element*/ Shiny.setInputValue(&quot;last_plot_clicked&quot;, this.id); }); }); The above snippet gets the user name and last plot clicked. We can catch the call to the server using the following snippet: # We wait for the output of alertme(), which will set the # &quot;username&quot; input value observeEvent( input$username , { cli::cat_rule(&quot;User name:&quot;) print(input$username) }) # This will print the id of the last clicked plot observeEvent( input$last_plot_clicked , { cli::cat_rule(&quot;Last plot clicked:&quot;) print(input$last_plot_clicked) }) Which will give: &gt; golex::run_app() Loading required package: shiny Listening on http://127.0.0.1:5495 ── User name: ───────────────────────────────────────────────────── [1] &quot;Colin&quot; ── Last plot clicked: ───────────────────────────────────────────── [1] &quot;plota&quot; ── Last plot clicked: ───────────────────────────────────────────── [1] &quot;plotb&quot; NOTE: If you are using modules, you will need to pass the namespacing of the id to be able to get it back from the server. This can be accomplished using the session$ns function. This comes by default using any golem-generated module. Example of a session$ns call used in Golem Module: $( document ).ready(function() { // Setting a custom handler that will // ask the users their name // then set the returned value to a Shiny input Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(&#39;whoareyou&#39;, function(arg) { var name = prompt(&quot;Who are you?&quot;) Shiny.setInputValue(arg.id, name); }) }); mod_my_first_module_ui &lt;- function(id){ ns &lt;- NS(id) tagList( actionButton( ns(&quot;showname&quot;), &quot;Enter your name&quot; ) ) } mod_my_first_module_server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ ns &lt;- session$ns # Whenever the button is clicked, # we call the CustomMessageHandler observeEvent( input$showname , { # Calling the &quot;whoareyou&quot; handler golem::invoke_js( &quot;whoareyou&quot;, # The id is namespaced, # so that we get it back on the server-side list( id = ns(&quot;name&quot;) ) ) }) # Waiting for input$name to be set with JavaScript observeEvent( input$name , { cli::cat_rule(&quot;Username is:&quot;) print(input$name) }) } "],["about-shinyjs-js-functions.html", "17.5 About {shinyjs} JS functions", " 17.5 About {shinyjs} JS functions As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, running JavaScript code you don’t fully control/understand can be tricky and may open vulnerabilities. It is always safer to use proven packages that have been tested and passed efficiency. For example shinyjs. See deanattali.com/shinyjs/ for more information. "],["one-last-thing-api-calls.html", "17.6 One last thing: API calls", " 17.6 One last thing: API calls If you ShinyApp uses API calls, there are good chances you are already doing this from R. However, there may be downsides to this approach. As an example, if you are limited by API calls (Twitter API, Google Map API). Due to these restrictions your end user may be limited in using your app. A work around is instead of using your Server’s IP to make the API call, wrap it in Javascript so you use your user’s IP instead! This allows your ShinyApp to scale. You use the fetch() JavaScript function to make API calls. For an example: tags$button(\"Get Me One!\", onclick = \"get_rand_beer()\"). Below is a general skeleton that works with an API that does not require authentication and returns a JSON object. Inside JavaScript (here, we create a function that will be available on an onclick event): // FUNCTION definition const get_rand_beer = () =&gt; { // Fetching the data fetch(&quot;https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers/random&quot;) // What do we do when we receive the data .then((data) =&gt;{ // TTurn the data to JSON data.json().then((res) =&gt; { // Send the json to R Shiny.setInputValue(&quot;beer&quot;, res, {priority: &#39;event&#39;}) }) }) // Define what happens if we fail to fetch .catch((error) =&gt; { alert(&quot;Error catching result from API&quot;) }) }; Observe the event in your server: observeEvent( input$beer , { # Do things with beer }) NOTE: The data shared between R and JavaScript is serialized to JSON, so you will have to manipulate the format once you recieve it in R.
