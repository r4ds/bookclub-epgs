In our case, we could say that 90% of the modules we write are never reused, they are here to allow us to split the codebase into smaller, more manageable pieces. 3.2.2 When to use {shiny} modules Start right from the beginning Yes, this takes a bit more time, but you will be saving yourselve volumes in the future (Your future self will love you!) 3.2.3 A practical walkthrough (Big code base example.

They are the backbone of the application and may not be specific to a given module. They can be added using {golem} with the add_fct(“name”) function. mod_* files contain a unique module. Many {shiny} apps contain a series of tabs, or at least a tab-like pattern, so we suggest that you number them according to their step in the application. Tabs are almost always named in the user interface, so that you can use this tab name as the file name. For example, if you build a dashboard where the first tab is called “Import”, you should name your file mod_01_import.R. You can create this file with a module skeleton using golem::add_module(“01_import”). utils_* are files that contain utilities, which are small helper functions. For example, you might want to have a not_na, which is not_na &lt;- Negate(is.na), a not_null, or small tools that you will be using application-wide. Note that you can also create utils for a specific module. *_ui_*, for example utils_ui.R, relates to the user interface. *_server_* are files that contain anything related to the application’s back-end. For example, fct_connection_server.R will contain functions that are related to the connection to a database, and are specifically used from the server side.

Simon To be failing gracefully and informatively can sometimes happen, but do not forget to put an informative bug message to avoid a grayish version of the application. Under some conditions you might not have the complete manner of all that is linked with your app (such as widgets in {DT} package) Good practices: add a bug message wrap all server calls (in case of crash reduce the amount of data loss) use a notification function with {shinyalert} and/or {attempt} packages As an example, if we want our app to be connected to a database, we use connect_db() connection in the server(). If the connection fails, we notify the user: conn &lt;- attempt::attempt({ connect_db() }) if (attempt::is_try_error(conn)){ # Notify the user send_notification(&quot;Could not connect&quot;) } else { # Continue computing if the connection was successful continue_computing() } 4.2.2 Building a self-evident app (or at least self-explanatory) self-evident: no demo required self-explanatory: no explanation required A.

The book reminds that: people make mistakes while using the app be sure your app doesn’t update all the times at any given imputs If the application reacts to all of the moves, the experience using the app can be bad, imagine that all the elements on the app update at any user input The best solution is to add one reactive button to give the user the opportunity to update results once all the changes have been made. 4.3.3 Too much interactivity A.

Many general Git tools require authentication. The information that is needed is your PAT. You can stored your PAT with gitcreds::gitcreds_set() command. Once this is done correctly you don’t need to do that again unless you require more strict rules on your VC tool, so that it might require you to regularly update your credentials.1 The basic commands in Git are: add: info or other addition to the project (i.e. Add a line to README and verify that Git notices the change) commit: engage the content with the repository (i.e. in RStudio click the bottom “commit” in the pane section of GitHub) The “commit” button creates a unique commit reference number: sha# And allows the user to make a comment about the commit, so to advise the others in the project or to remind the user about it. push: send the content to the server and so to the repository pull: receive the changes/updates from the repository 6.2.3 About branches The “main” branch is the one that appears at the beginning of the project, but other branches can be created. Secondary branches are work areas, usually for the other in the team to have a further layer of security of the “main” content. When you work on a shared project, your collaborators need to name a new branch to interact with the repository. This imply the creation of mirrored repositories that can be absolutely equal or slightly different, as the requested additions/modifications are accepted. 6.2.4 Issues Issues are another way to advise the main repository of some modifications that would be needed. They are used to propose changes, to track a bug or to suggest a feature, and can be done directly by the GitHub page of the repository. An issue creates a “message exchange” form of communication with the repository owner, for advising about something that can be improved. happygitwithr.com↩︎ "],["git-integration.html", "6.3 Git integration", " 6.3 Git integration 6.3.1 With RStudio In our case we are interested in how to use GitHub with RStudio, and how to set it up in a new project.
